### Explain the Demo Concepts

* Explain the quality process with fork, PR and code-review

### Demonstrate Storing Code Changes in Git Repository
* Explain that the developer should commit the code changes to his Git
repository to be able to shared them for code-review with the team
* Right-click on inventory in the *Project Explorer* in JBDS, click on
*Team* and then on *Commit*

* In the *Unstaged Changes* field, click and drag
+InventoryService.java+ and +InventoryServiceTest.java+ to *Staged Changes*
field to specify which changes should be committed to the Git
repository.
* Specify +Issue #312 fixed+ in the *Commit Message* field and click on

* If asked for username and password, enter the developer username and
password and then click on *OK* and *OK* again.
** Username: _{{GOGS_DEV_USER}}_
** Password: _{{GOGS_DEV_PASSWORD}}_

* Explain that the code change is stored in the developers Git
repository

### Demonstrate Submitting Changes for Code Review

* Go to *Gogs* web.

====
NOTE: *Gogs* git server is used in this demo as the Git repository and it is deployed in the *CI/CD* project and accessible at {{GOGS_URL}}. Open *Gogs* in your browser in a new tab by entering the correct URL. Alternatively, click on *OpenShift Container Platform* logo in the header,
then on *CI/CD* project and then on *Gogs* route URL to open *Gogs* in a new tab.
====

* In *Gogs* web, click on Sign In and enter the developer credentials
** Username: _{{GOGS_DEV_USER}}_
** Password: _{{GOGS_DEV_PASSWORD}}_

* In *My Repositories*, click on *coolstore-microservices* repository
* Explain that the repository displays the last code commit by the
developer user from the previous steps

* Click on the green compare button displayed above to see the
differences between the developer Git repository and the teams Git
repository
* Scroll down and explain that the only change is the code you committed
to the Git repository in the previous steps
* Specify +Issue #312 fixed+ in the *Title* field and click on *Create Pull Request* button
* Explain that the the _Pull Request_ is created now and the developer and
can discuss the changes with code-reviewers in form of comments on this
_Pull Request_ page

### Demonstrate Code Review Process

* Click on *User profile and more* icon and then *Sign Out*

* Explain that you will login as a senior code reviewer with privileges
to commit code to the team repository
* In *Gogs* web, click on *Sign In* and enter the team credentials to log in as a code reviewer
** Username: _{{GOGS_REVIEWER_USER}}_
** Password: _{{GOGS_REVIEWER_PASSWORD}}_

* In *My Repositories*, click on *coolstore-microservices* repository
* Explain that the team repository does not contain the changes made by
the developer since they are not reviewed yet. Point out the last commit
which is different from the commit developer made in previous steps
* Explain that there is one _Pull Request_ waiting on the repository to be
reviewed
* Click on the *Pull Request* tab and then on the *Issue #312 fixed* _Pull Request_

image::/images/demo/msa-dev-pullrequests.png[Pull Requests,width=1000,align=center]

* Explain that code-reviewer can study the changes made by looking at
the *Commits* and *Files changed* tabs and comment on the changes
* Write a comment with ++1+ as the message and click on the
*Comment* button to show your approval
* Explain that in different teams, there are different conventions on
how many ++1+s a _Pull Request_ should have to be eligible for merge to the
team repository. In our demo, one is enough!
* Click on *Merge Pull Request* button to merge the code changes to the
team repository
