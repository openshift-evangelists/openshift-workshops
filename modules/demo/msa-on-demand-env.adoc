### Explain the Demo Concepts

* Explain the use-case: a JIRA issue is assigned to the developer to fix
a bug in the *Inventory* microservice which runs on JBoss EAP 7. He needs
to deploy the exact version of the source code containing the issue in a
environment to investigate and possibly correct the problem. Since
ordering new servers used to take 6 weeks, he usually repurposed one of
the existing allocated servers. He would then spent only 1 day cleaning
up the server, installing JDK and middleware and deploy the application
on it so that he can start investigating. Taking advantage of containers
and self-service, all that is reduced to a few minutes.

### Demonstrate Creating Personal Repository from Project Repository

====
NOTE: *Gogs* git server is used in this demo as the Git repository and it is deployed in the *CI/CD* project and accessible at {{GOGS_URL}}. Open *Gogs* in your browser in a new tab by entering the correct URL. Alternatively, click on *OpenShift Container Platform* logo in the header,
then on *CI/CD* project and then on *Gogs* route URL to open *Gogs* in a new tab.
====

* Explain *Gogs* as the team source repository where the CoolStore
application source code and configuration is stored and managed
* In *Gogs* web, click on *Sign In* and enter the developer credentials
** Username: _{{GOGS_DEV_USER}}_
** Password: _{{GOGS_DEV_PASSWORD}}_

* In top navigation, click on Explore

* Explain that the source code for the application is stored in the
*coolstore-microservice* team repository. Click on
*coolstore-microservice* repository.

* Explain the teams quality process using the
https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1bt4k9yB0wDOj0d5WzDCWqftPxIizQ7f5S15LysEGFyQ/edit#slide=id.g1b64d8284a_0_24[slides]:
no change is allowed to be directly committed in the team code
repository. Team members should create a copy of the the source repo via
forking the repo, make the changes in their personal repository and send
a _Pull Request_ to the team repository. Pull requests are merged to the
team repository after being reviewed by senior members of the team. This
process allows to discover issues and bugs as close as possible to the
developers while their mind is fresh.
* Click on *Fork* button, to create a copy of the repository in the
developers account. The number on the button shows the number of times
this repository is forked. Click then on *Fork Repository*.

* Explain that the repository is created now on the developer account as
a fork of the team account.

* Click on the *Copy* icon and write down the Git repo url which will be
used in the next steps.

### Demonstrate On-demand Deployment in Developer Project

* Click on *OpenShift Container Platform* logo in the header to list projects
* Explain that if admin allows a user to create projects, a button with
the label New Project would appear above all projects on the right side.
The user can click on *New Project* button to create new projects.

====
IMPORTANT: The demo environment might not allow creating new projects and therefore the *New Project* button might not be visible.
====

* Explain that developer has a personal project called *Developer
Project* that only he has access to as a private working space
* Click on *Developer Project* in the list of projects
* Explain that currently nothing is deployed in this project and the
developer wants to provision the application in his project using his
forked repository created in previous steps
* Click on *Add to Project*
* Explain that using templates, developer can deploy an entire
application with all its components at once
* Scroll down and find the *inventory* template in the catalog

image::/images/demo/msa-ondemand-template.png[Application Template,width=920,align=center]

* Explain that the tags assigned to the template such as _microservices_,
_jboss_ and _angularjs_ are searchable and allow developers to filter
templates based on tags
* Click on the *inventory* template
* Explain that developer can customize the deployment via the template
parameters. For example the *Git repository* and *Git branch/tag* parameters
specify which repository and branch contain the application source
code.

====
NOTE: The default values of all parameters are set correctly
for this demo. The *Git repository* parameter contains the URL to the forked
repository in the previous steps: {{GOGS_DEV_REPO_URL}}
====

* Paste the Git repository URL forked in previous steps for the *Git repository* parameter
* Click on *Create* button to deploy the *inventory* service
* Explain the Source-to-Image mechanism using the
https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1bt4k9yB0wDOj0d5WzDCWqftPxIizQ7f5S15LysEGFyQ/edit#slide=id.g1b64d8284a_0_29[slides] and
that it gets started, clones the source code from developers forked Git
repository and starts building the application.

* Explain that the developer now has a personal environment with the
correct version of *Inventory* service deployed so he can start
investigating the issue. Took just a minute compared to days and weeks
before!
