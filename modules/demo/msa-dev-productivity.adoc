IMPORTANT: JBoss Developer Studio (JBDS) should be installed on your
workstation laptop for this module. JBDS 10.2.0.GA is used at the time of writing
these instructions.

### Explain the Demo Concepts

* Explain the use case: TBD.

### Demonstrate connecting to OpenShift from JBoss Developer Studio (JBDS)
* Explain that to be able to use the OpenShift 3 tooling in JBDS, you
must first create an OpenShift 3 connection.
* In the *OpenShift Explorer* view, click *New Connection Wizard*. In case
the *OpenShift Explorer* view is not available, enter +openshift+ in *Quick Access*
search box and click on *OpenShift Explorer* after you find it.

* In the *New OpenShift Connection* wizard, enter OpenShift master url in
the *Server* field. In the *Authentication* panel, change the *Protocol* to
*Basic* and enter your username and password in *Username* and
*Password* fields respectively. Click on *Finish*.

* If the Untrusted SSL Certificatewindow is displayed, make sure
Remember decision (it can be changed) is checked and click on Yes
* Explain that a connection to the OpenShift master is listed in the
*OpenShift Explorer* view

* Demonstrate importing an OpenShift application into the local
workspace in JBDS
* Explain that applications associated with your OpenShift account are
listed in the *OpenShift Explorer* view and the source code for these
applications can be individually imported into the JBDS using the Git
repository used for deploying the application. Once imported, the user
can easily modify the application source code, as required, build the
application and view it in a web browser.
* In the *OpenShift Explorer* view, expand the connection to locate the
*inventory* service in the *Developer Project*

image::/images/demo/msa-jbds-inventory-deployment.png[Inventory Container,width=920,align=center]

* Right-click on *inventory* and click *Import Application*.
* In the *Import OpenShift Application* wizard, ensure the location in the
*Git Clone Destination* field corresponds to where you want to make a
local copy of the OpenShift application Git repository (or leave the
default value) and click on *Finish*.
* Explain that the application is listed in the *Project Explorer* view.

* Explain that in order to reduce turnaround time from code change to
deployment for developers, a container running OpenShift can be added as
a *Server* in JBDS and use hot deployment to only deploy the changed code
instead of building the entire code base on every change. This allows to
reduce the time required to deploy the changes on a container on
OpenShift to seconds during the development phase.
* In the *OpenShift Explorer* view, expand the connection to locate the
*inventory* service in the *Developer Project*
* Right-click on *inventory* and click *Server Adapter* and then *Finish*
* The *inventory* container is added as a JBoss EAP 7 *Server* to JBDS

* Explain that with hot-deployment enabled, every change is
automatically deployed to the container running on OpenShift. In order
to give control to the developer and deploy changes when developer wants
to, you can change this behavior from automatic to manual.
* In the *Servers* view, double-click on *inventory* server to open it in
the editor
* In the *Publishing* panel, select *Never publish automatically* and save
the configuration (Ctrl+S or Cmd+S)

### Demonstrate Changing Code and Live Testing on OpenShift with JBDS

* Explain the use-case: since backoffice system is an old ERP and takes
longer to update, temporarily we update the inventory microservice to
show no inventory for those products. This is an urgent change and for
every day that products are displayed in the CoolStore, we have to pay
penalty to the vendor.
* In the *OpenShift Explorer* view, expand the connection to locate the
*inventory* service in the *Developer Project*. Right-click on it and click
on *Show In* and then *Web Browser* to open the Inventory service in the
built-in web browser in JBDS
* Explain that the web browser shows the *Inventory* service Swagger UI
which is integrated into the service to facilitate testing the REST
endpoints
* Click on *GET* and scroll down to specify +165613+ (one of the recalled
products) in the *itemId* field. Click on *Try it out!*

image::/images/demo/msa-jbds-test-api-before.png[Test API Endpoint,width=640,align=center]

* Explain that the product is in the inventory despite being recalled.
The developer should modify the Inventory service to return no inventory
until backoffice ERP system is updated.
* Explain that in Test Driven Developer (TDD) one of techniques used to
increased software quality is test-first development approach where a
unit test is created before making the code change. The test fails until
there is enough code written to fulfill the test. Lets create a test
first
* In the *Package Explorer* view, expand the project to locate
+InventoryServiceTest.java+ and double-click on it to open it in the
editor.

image::/images/demo/msa-jbds-java-test.png[Unit Test,width=360,align=center]

* Explain that +InventoryServiceTest.java+ is a unit test that tests
*inventory* service by mocking the database and verifies that the recalled
products do not have any inventory

image::/images/demo/msa-jbds-java-test-verify.png[Unit Test Verification,width=800,align=center]

* Explain that this unit test is not included in the test suites since
it is annotated with +@Ignore+

image::/images/demo/msa-jbds-java-test-ignore.png[Unit Test Skipped,width=720,align=center]

* Remove the +@Ignore+ annotation from the class and save the file (Ctrl+S or Cmd+S)
* Explain that you can run unit tests directly inside JBDS
* In the *Project Explorer* view, right-click on
+InventoryServiceTest.java+, click on *Run As* and then *JUnit Test*.
* Explain that the unit test gets executed and fails. This is expected
because developer hasn't made the code changes required to pass the test
yet.

image::/images/demo/msa-jbds-junit-failed.png[Unit Tests Failed,width=860,align=center]

* To make the code changes to pass the test, locate
+InventoryService.java+ in the *Package Explorer* view and double-click on
it to open it in the editor

image::/images/demo/msa-jbds-java-service.png[Inventory Service,width=360,align=center]

* Explain that the lines that are commented out (starting with +//+) check
if the product number is within the recalled products the this services
returns no inventory for that product.
* Remove the comments (+//+) from beginning of the commented lines and
save the file (Ctrl+S or Cmd+S).

image::/images/demo/msa-jbds-java-commented.png[Code Commented Out,width=600,align=center]

* In the *JUnit* view, right-click on the test and then on *Run* to execute
the unit tests once more
* Explain that the unit tests pass this time and the test requirement is
fulfilled

image::/images/demo/msa-jbds-junit-passed.png[Unit Tests Passed,width=920,align=center]

* Explain that now that the changes are ready, developer should test
them on an environment similar to production with the same version of
JBoss EAP 7, operating system, JDK, etc to make sure false-positives
don't occur due to inconsistent environment.
* In the *Servers* view, right-click on *inventory* and then *Incremental
Publish*
* Explain that only files that have been changed by the developer will
be copied directly into the JBoss EAP 7 container on OpenShift where
*Inventory* service is deployed

image::/images/demo/msa-jbds-server-publish.png[Code Synced with Container,width=700,align=center]

* Go to the built-in browser opened in the previous steps
* Click on *Try it out!* to test the endpoint again
* Explain that the inventory now shows zero for the recalled products
