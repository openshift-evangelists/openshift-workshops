### Explain the Demo Concepts

* Explain Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery using the

* Explain the CoolStore pipeline
using https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1bt4k9yB0wDOj0d5WzDCWqftPxIizQ7f5S15LysEGFyQ/edit#slide=id.g1b95a791a8_0_9[the slides]

### Demonstrate Automated Deployments via CI/CD Pipelines
* In the OpenShift web console, go to *CI/CD* project
* On the left sidebar menu, click on *Builds* and then *Pipelines*
* Explain that *inventory-pipeline* is an OpenShift pipeline that takes
any change committed to the *coolstore-microservices* team Git repository
through various steps until it is deployed in production.
* If coming from previous modules, explain that the pipeline was
triggered when team member (code reviewer) merged the _Pull Request_ in
the repository. The pipeline has taken the code changes through DEV
environment and after test succeeded, it has promoted the changes to the
TEST environment to run system-integration tests with all dependent
services deployed. When tests succeed, then the new version is promoted
to the PROD parallel to the existing version that is serving customers .
It is waiting for the release managers manual approval to Go Live and
redirect the production traffic to the new version. The manual approval
is typically integrated into existing IT workflow management services
such as ServiceNow, EMC Remedy and JIRA Service Desk. In ChatOps, this
step would be integrated into Slack or other chat systems and would be
controlled via a chat bot. In this demo, we will use Jenkins directly to
approve deployments.

* Explain zero-downtime deployment strategies (e.g. blue/green) using
https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1bt4k9yB0wDOj0d5WzDCWqftPxIizQ7f5S15LysEGFyQ/edit#slide=id.g19ddf4bec2_0_465[the sides] and
how every minute of downtime for an e-commerce company equals lost revenue.
* Explain the blue/green deployment in the pipeline using
https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1bt4k9yB0wDOj0d5WzDCWqftPxIizQ7f5S15LysEGFyQ/edit#slide=id.g1b95a791a8_0_9[the slides]
and point that changes are already deployed in production but
user traffic is not switched to the new version and would happen after approval.
* Click on the projects drop-down list on top of the page and then on
*CoolStore PROD*

* Scroll down to the *Inventory Live* service
* Explain that there are two version of inventory deployed in
production: *inventory-blue* and *inventory-green*. The traffic split shows
that 100% of traffic is going to *inventory-blue* and 0% is going to
*inventory-green*. Comparing the deployment times shows that the code
changes are deployed to the *inventory-green* (deployed 7 minutes ago in
the screenshot). Adjust the traffic split to other ratios (for example
90% and 10%) allows performing other deployment patterns such as canary
release or even A/B testing.

* In the *Web UI* service group, click on the route url
* Explain that the recalled product (Solid Performance Polo) is still
shows up in-stock on the CoolStore and is possible to order the product.

* Explain that when *Go Live* is approved, the router switches the
traffic to the inventory-green that holds the new version of *Inventory*
service. If not approved, the *Live* version stays the same as before and
the new version gets discarded.
* Click on the *Input Required* link under the *Approve Go Live* stage. Jenkins opens in a new tab.
** Jenkins URL: {{JENKINS_URL}}
* Explain that Jenkins can integrate into OpenShift authorization mechanism so that
users can log in using their OpenShift credentials.
* Log in using your OpenShift credentials
* Explain that in Jenkins, you can enable role-based authorization and
people with correct privileges will be able to approve going live in
production
* Click on *Proceed* button to approve the *Go Live*. The Jenkins page shows
the pipeline logs as it proceeds.
* Go back to OpenShift web console, click on the projects drop-down list
on top of the page and then on *CI/CD*. On the left sidebar menu, click on
*Builds* and then *Pipelines*.
* Explain that the pipeline is finished successfully and the new version
is Live now

* In the OpenShift web console, click on *CoolStore PROD* project
* In the *Web UI* service group, click on the route url
* Explain that the the recalled product is out of stock.
