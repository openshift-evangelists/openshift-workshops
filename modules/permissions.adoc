## Lab: OpenShift Role-Based Access Control

### Background

Almost every interaction with an OpenShift environment that you can think of
requires going through the master's API. All API interactions are both
authenticated (AuthN - who are you?) and authorized (AuthZ - are you allowed to
do what you are asking?).

In the log aggregation lab we saw that there was an error in reference to a
*Service Account*. Just like a user has permissions (AuthZ), sometimes we may
wish for non-users to be able to perform actions against the API. These
"non-users" are referred to as service accounts.

OpenShift automatically creates a few special service accounts in every project.
The **default** service account has its credentials automatically injected into
every pod that is launched. By changing the permissions for that service
account, we can do intersting things.

#### Exercise: Grant Service Account View Permissions
The parksmap application wants to talk to the OpenShift API to learn about other
*Pods*, *Services*, and resources within the *Project*. You'll learn why soon!

[source]
----
oc project explore{{USER_SUFFIX}}
----

Then:

[source]
----
oc policy add-role-to-user view system:serviceaccount:explore{{USER_SUFFIX}}:default
----

Now that the default *Service Account* has **view** access, it can query the API
to see what resources are within the *Project*. This also has the added benefit
of supressing the error message! Although, in reality, we fixed the application.

#### Exercise: Grant User View Permissions

[source]
----
oc policy add-role-to-user view user{{USER_SUFFIX}}
----

One more step is required. We need to re-deploy the application because it's
given up trying to query the API.

#### Exercise: Redeploy Application
This time we'll use the web console. Find your `explore{{USER_SUFFIX}}` project,
and then click "Applications" and then "Deployments". You'll see your only
application, `parksmap`, listed. Click that.

The deployment screen tells you a lot about how the application will be
deployed. At the top right, there is a button labeled "Deploy". This button will
cause a new deployment (which you know creates a new *ReplicationController*,
right?).

Click it.

You'll see that a new deployment is immediately started. Return to the overview
page and watch it happen. You might not be fast enough!

If you look at the logs for the application now, you should see no errors.
That's great. But our application is still an empty map, which isn't very
exciting. Let's build another microservice -- a back end for this front end map
-- using OpenShift's Source-to-Image (S2I) technology.
